# Assignment Submission Repository

I made this repository for all assignments assigned to the **Grads Batch**, taken by **Pankaj Sir**.

## 📌 Objective
- Maintain a single, organized repository for all submissions  
- Enable easy review, tracking, and reference  
- Encourage clean and structured code practices  

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Each assignment is stored in its own directory  
- Directory names reflect the assignment number or topic  
- Relevant source code and resources are grouped together  


## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository is strictly for **educational purposes** and internal evaluation.
